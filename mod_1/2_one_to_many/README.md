# One to Many Relationships
We've learned how to create singular models, but it is time to take the next step and look at how to display relationships between models. 

## Objectives:

- One to Many relationships.

- Single source of truth



## Deliverables:

- Create `Bank` class with name attribute.
- Create an `Account` class with account_number, first_name and last_name attibutes.
- Create an `Account` class variable `all` and the method `#all` that returns an array of all instances of `Account`.
- Add `bank` attribute to the Account class.
- Create an `#add_account` method to the `Bank` class.
